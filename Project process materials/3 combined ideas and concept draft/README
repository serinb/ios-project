We decided finally to meet this group's needs by creating a time tracking app that not only helps users to track tasks that they are currently working on, but to also provide the option of scheduling these tasks ahead of time and notifying them when there due. That way our app can assist them in keeping track of their responsibilities regarding their uni studies and other parts of their life. Our goal is also to make the user aware of how productive they are by showing the progress that they have achieved via multiple time-view statistics and a daily progress bar.
